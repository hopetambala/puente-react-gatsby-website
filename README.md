## Development

This project is built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). Gatsby use's [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to retrieve data from Contentful. 

This project is a bootstrapped using Gatsby

Here are some quick commands to get started:

- `yarn install`: Install Node dependencies
- `yarn run develop`: Start the gatsby development server.
- `yarn setup`: Run's a setup script that connects this application to the Contentful CMS. Needs system arguments
- `yarn run build`: Build a production optimized bundle of the app.
- `yarn run deploy`: Deploy a production optimized bundle of the app to AWS s3

#### Permissions and Settings
There's a decent amount that'll be necessary to get this publically consumed on the AWS website itself. Follow [this](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/articles/deploying-a-react-app-to-s3/) guide to get those hammered out.
